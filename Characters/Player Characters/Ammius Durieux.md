This one is me!
Age 22, 5'8", 155lbs.
**Personality Traits**
The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
**Ideals**
Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
**Bonds**
I’m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
**Flaws**
When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it.
